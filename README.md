* Fixed the dropdown opening at the bottom of a dialog
  * See https://github.com/jaredrummler/MaterialSpinner/issues/31
* Patched `expand()` to correctly open to the top on newer API versions
  * Otherwise, it expands to the bottom and you can barely select anything
* Added test spinner at bottom of layout in demo
